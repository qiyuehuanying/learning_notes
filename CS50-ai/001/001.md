## 搜索问题
### 搜索问题中的概念
- agent:解决问题的实体
- state：agent所处的环境
- initial state：每个agent所处的初始环境，是state的子集
- actions: agent在不同state下可以采取的行动 Action(s)，s是state的子集
- transition model：Result（s,a）, returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s
- state space : the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions
- goal test: way to determine whether a given state is a goal state
- path cost: numerical cost associated with a given path
- path cost function: return a cost with a certain path 
- optimal solution: a solution that has the lowest path cost among all solution
- node :the structure used in search problem include:
  - a state
  - a parent(node that generated this node)
  - an action (an action applied to parent to get node)
  - a path cost(from initial state to this node)
- uninformed search:doing strategy without problem-specific knowledge like BFS,DFS
- informed search:doing strategy with problem-specific knowledge to find solution:
  - greedy best-first search:use a function <font color = yellow>h()</font>(heuristic--启发) to estimate that how close we are to the goal 
  - A* search:search algorithm that expands node with lowest value of g(n)+h(n)<br>
   <br>g(n)=cost to reach node
   <br>h(n)=estimated cost to goal
### MINIMAX
- MAX(X)aims to maximize score
- MIN(O)aims to minimize score
### ALpha-Beta pruning

### Depth-Limited Minimax
